# DAT490_Capstone
This is the full capstone project from my final data science class. My partner and I built a machine learning music recommendation system from scratch, inspired by the models that Spotify and other streaming platforms use to recommend songs to their users. 
The code is meant to be ran on either the Million Song Subset or the full Million Song Database. The subset includes only 10,000 observations, but makes it possible to run locally. The full dataset is only available on an AWS server. You'll have to download the subset if you want to run the code locally - http://millionsongdataset.com/pages/getting-dataset/#subset
